									<div class="post-cont">
										<p class="spical"><b>If you had asked Roni afterwards, he would have told you directly, it was the result of poor planning. </b> </p>
										<p>He had decided to venture into the wilds of the Un'Goro crater to aid a few weary souls who had set up camp in the dangerous region. Perhaps he was disctracted when he journeyed out, because he hardly prepared for his journey, and it would prove to be an extremely necessary missed preparation. <br>
											As he headed out, he held his tasks in his mind. There was a certain lifeform existing in the crater that was not quite plant, nor exactly beast. "Bloodpetals," as they were referred to, grew from the ground into small sprouts, until they were developed enough to begin walking. The species was more invasive than any Roni had ever seen, spreading their seeds wildly as they flailed their branches around, scurrying hecticly across the crater floor in every direction. As sprouts, they were small enough to step on, but if they were left unchecked, they could grow to be larger than full grown tauren!  </p>
											<p class="spical">	And so, Roni's task was to help rid the region of these pests, and collect special parts of the specimens that he erradicated; rare petals that Roni's requestor was studying. And so, he headed out into the land, with his mind in the wrong place. Perhaps he was thinking about the not-so-distant Devilsaurs, shaking the ground with their stomping footsteps, or the frenzied pterodax, flying about the canopy above him whilst screeching hungrily. Whatever his fear was, would not prove to be what actually put him at risk, however; for it was his fear alone that caused his distraction, and caused him to forget to pack adequete rations and supplies.<br> He brought not bread, nor water, nor flint and tinder; he had no roasted quail, nor potion for health nor scroll to supplement his stamina. He was completely unprepared to brave the region, and completely oblivious to the fact.</p>
											
											<p>As he made his way out into the lush, green, beautifully overgrown, hot, humid, and extremely deadly crater,  he avoided the beasts and began his work. The pests were everywhere; he couldn't turn his head any one way without seeing at least a few, large or small. He cut through them, severing their branches from their sternums, and tearing them apart until they could no longer flail or move, and white sap oozed from their wounds and slowly pooled on the ground. The Bloodpetals that had grown to be as large as Roni, or larger, were more of a challenge than he expected, viciously spinning and whipping every branch around their trunk towards the warrior at their first sense of danger. They were covered in fungus, too; mushrooms of several varieties, moss, and hair-like spores that grew to stretch several inches outward and waved around mindlessly like hundreds of miniature tenticles. </p>
											<p class="spical">It wasn't long before night fell on Roni, and he was tarnished from battle and more than ready to rest. He reached for his bag as he felt his stomach grumble- and he realized then his mistake. His thirst and hunger hit him all at once, and he knew he should head back to the camp at once... But in the smooth contrast and utter darkness of the setting sun from the bottom of a crater, he had become turned around, and lost his way. Now, his panic began to set in, as he remembered the many beasts that still lingered, and recognized that he was running out of energy, fast.  As his fear set it, he took several steps backwards, and quickly bumped into yet another fully developed Bloodpetal, which began squirming and wretching instantly at the touch. Roni pulled his blade, and sliced the creature apart, and... as oddly as it sounds, and as little as he'll ever like to admit it, the scent that was emitted from the mouldy spores was actually favorable to him in that moment. When the battle ended, Roni knelt curiously before the pile of plant matter and took a closer sniff. What he smelled was extremely appealing.... but why?</p>
											
											<p>He picked up a chunk of his foe and examined it. Small, black mushrooms grew on it in tiny clusters. He plucked one off and eyed it dubiously, before placing it on his tongue without further thought. It was delicious! His eyes widened as the raw, truffle-like mushroom melted in his mouth, and afterwards began to scoop at the rest of the clusters, proceeding to eat them like berries. Not only were they kind to his taste buds, but he almost instantly felt his energy being restored. His thoughts raced for a moment as he tried to understand, but it wasn't long at all before any attempt at reason was but a wispy cloud in the sky; it needed no explanation, it simply was. 
												<p class="spical">After filling his belly, he sat for a moment, feeling refreshed. His eyes had adjusted to the darkness by now, and as he regained his composure and his sense of direction, he stood again, and began to head back to the camp. He avoided the rest of the Bloodpetals on the way back, and after a few more hours, finally saw the torches of the camp he sought, and smelled the fire burning, roasting the quail. He returned without further incident, filled his belly once more, and slept as a boulder would that night.
